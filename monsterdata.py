A bull will likely attack if he sees quick movements from creatures he might be able to reach with a charge.

As one ages and its colors dull, this ability improves; when lying in wait, they gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 at age categories 2 and 3, on 1-4 in age categories 4 through 6, and on 1-5 at age category 7.",

They often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).",

Coloring is dependent on the species of eagle,  and should be chosen by the GM; various brown, gray, black, or white markings are most common, though solid darker colors are sometimes seen.

In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20', having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength.  In lairs of 30 or more there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with a shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11) having a +2 bonus to damage.  In the lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive.  In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock.  A shaman is equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1.

        "Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water.  They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action.  However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.",
        "Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin.  This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.",
        "Three-quarters of mermaid births are female.  Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails.  Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother.  Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females.  A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader.  Such a group is called a pod.",
        "A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men.  Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children or juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing).  Adventurers generally meet mermaids only in groups of one or two.",

Like spiders, they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise climb entirely upside down.",

Escaping from the sticky hold requires a successful roll to open doors.  If both legs hit, this roll frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa can simply attack again with the free leg on the next round.  Alternately, victims may attack with small or medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2 to the attack roll if a small weapon is used.  If the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in this case another character can help, making the roll for the victim).",

Otherwise, the victim does not notice the grubs.

Trees to be animated must be within 180 feet of the treant, and must remain within that range or they will return to their normal state.  An animated tree requires a full round to uproot itself before it can move around, and then can move at a rate of just 10' per round.  Of course, if enemies are within reach the animated tree need not be uprooted.  If the treant controlling an animated tree is slain or incapacitated, the tree returns to its normal state.",
        "Note that animated trees will automatically root themselves when returning to their normal, dormant state; if such a tree finds itself on stone or some other surface it cannot penetrate, it will move around randomly for 1d6 rounds until it accidentally finds a suitable area, or failing that, until it topples and falls.  Any character or creature nearby when this happens must save vs. Death Ray to scamper away; those who fail will suffer 2d6 points of damage and will be trapped under the fallen tree.  The GM should consider battlefield conditions when deciding on the exact results of such an event."

        "Trolls are huge, rangy humanoids with lumpy skin that is a dull grayish green in color.  They stand up to 9 feet tall despite having a rather hunched posture, and may weigh as much as 600 pounds.  Their skin is rubbery and slightly damp to the touch, and they have long sharp black claws and long sharp white teeth.  Trolls have a disconcerting tendency to smile toothily most of the time, as if their brutal lives are the most entertaining thing imaginable.",
        "Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of damage each round after being injured.  A troll reduced to 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point.  Note that the troll may \"play dead\" until it has regenerated further.  Damage from fire and acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a troll can only be killed by this sort of damage.  The lower morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces attackers armed with fire or acid.",
        "The regenerative power of trolls is so great that limbs or other body parts (even a head!) can be reattached if severed simply by pressing the severed ends back together for a moment.  Trolls in a group will generally help dismembered fellows to reassemble themselves, but only if it's convenient.  If the severed part is not restored, a new one will grow in its place in 1d4 turns.  Note that a troll with a new head will not remember its former life, nor will it yet know how to speak; it will behave as would any confused and hostile animal.",
        "Trolls speak a primitive language, and are often fluent in Goblin, Hobgoblin, Orc, Ogre, or Giant depending on which of these species live nearest them.  A few (20% or so) speak Common.",
        "Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed.  Though trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and claws."

A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the indicated duration.  No attack roll is required, but a save vs. Death Ray is allowed to resist.  A sperm whale can emit as many such blasts of sound as it desires, once per round, instead of biting."
