A giant bombardier beetle can use this spray attack up to five times per day, but no more than once per three rounds.  Faced with enemies attacking from one direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to turn away and use the spray attack rather than biting.",
        "Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have about the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind."

Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure), and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd.  A bull will likely attack if he sees quick movements from creatures he might be able to reach with a charge.  Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a roughly circular formation with their heads outward, while calves will be kept in the center, though if the opponents are small enough they may instead charge en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.",

This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round.  To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies).  If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell."

The gore attack may only be used against a single man-sized or larger creature, but may be used in the same round as the trample if the creature being gored is larger than man sized.

The color dulls and darkens with age until it reaches an almost uniform tan color at the oldest age category.  They have long sinuous bodies and unusually long legs, giving them the fastest land movement rate of any dragon, but they are also accomplished fliers, as fast and maneuverable as any dragon.",
        "Plains dragons may hunt on the wing, attacking suddenly from above and surprising on 1-3 on 1d6; or, they may lie in wait in tall grass or a copse of trees, using their coloration as camouflage.  As one ages and its colors dull, this ability improves; when lying in wait, they gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 at age categories 2 and 3, on 1-4 in age categories 4 through 6, and on 1-5 at age category 7.",

Fish-eating eagles are usually the largest varieties, while other types hunt small animals such as rodents or snakes.  Coloring is dependent on the species of eagle,  and should be chosen by the GM; various brown, gray, black, or white markings are most common, though solid darker colors are sometimes seen.  The beaks may range from bright yellowish orange to black.  Eagles will dive at a prey and attack with both sets of talons, then attack with the beak."

Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torch flame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does.

Each clan rules over and controls a group of 1d6 mountain peaks, generally spanning an area with a 5-6 mile diameter.  They prefer peaks connected by high ridges so that they do not have to descend too far when walking their territory.  Clan members who are mated establish households within the territory; unmarried members typically live with their parents until they are wed.  The \"lair\" encounter figures above are for a single household, but if one household is attacked and the attackers subsequently retreat, upon their return they will usually find much of the rest of the clan waiting for them in ambush.",

If they live near storm giants, they may trade for better weapons (the second damage rating given above) but usually cannot afford storm giant armor.",

        "Iron golems are huge, generally 11 to 12 feet in height with a weight of 4,500 to 5,500 pounds.  Such golems are usually fashioned like statues, and may appear to be wearing armor and armed with a shortsword or mace; the sculpting will often be simpler and cruder than that done by a real sculptor.  Though an iron golem has no voice, it is hardly silent when in motion, as its gentlest footstep on any hard surface shakes the floor and walls.  Note that, while an iron golem has little if any odor normally, when wet they have a strong metallic smell detectable up to 60 feet away.",
        "Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which fills a 10-foot cube and persists for 1 round.  Those within the area of effect must save vs. Dragon Breath or die.  This ability can be used up to 3 times per day.",
        "A magical attack that deals lightning or electrical damage slows an iron golem (as the reverse of the haste spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  Attacks using fire heal 1 point of damage per every 3 points the attack would normally inflict, rounded down; further, such an attack breaks any ongoing slow effect on the golem.  As usual, healing will not increase the monster above its normal hit points.  For example, an iron golem hit by a fireball which should deal 17 points of damage instead receives up to 5 points of healing.  An iron golem is affected by rust attacks such as that of a rust monster, suffering 2d6 points of damage for each hit (with no saving throw normally allowed)."

Individuals are shorter than the common variety, standing just 5 to 6 feet tall, due in part to their somewhat \"hunched\" stance.  They weigh about as much as the common type.",
        "These monsters can change color at will, allowing them to blend into underground environments so well that they gain surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6.  Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills.",
        "Subterranean lizard men secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard character races) find the scent repulsive, and those within 10 feet of one must make a saving throw versus poison. Those failing the save suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain within 10 feet of the creature.  Getting out of range negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates the penalty without an additional saving throw. The results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after which a new save must be rolled."

Escaping from the sticky hold requires a successful roll to open doors.  If both legs hit, this roll frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa can simply attack again with the free leg on the next round.  Alternately, victims may attack with small or medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2 to the attack roll if a small weapon is used.  If the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in this case another character can help, making the roll for the victim).",

A roc's plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail.  Like most birds, the males have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be hidden, that is).",

For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1,200.  Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3,000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to 6,000 pounds.  Tales of giant rocs carrying off full-grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds.",
        "A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour.  Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the roc to carry.  While being carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to be as \"fresh\" as possible when given to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary).",
        "When rocs are encountered they are almost certainly hunting, and will generally attack creatures of horse size or less.  If facing a large group the rocs may make passes close overhead to scatter them first before each chooses a single target to prey upon.  Mated pairs found in their nests will fight to the death to protect their eggs or offspring (morale of 12 in this case)."

An animated tree requires a full round to uproot itself before it can move around, and then can move at a rate of just 10' per round.

Any character or creature nearby when this happens must save vs. Death Ray to scamper away; those who fail will suffer 2d6 points of damage and will be trapped under the fallen tree.

A vampire has all the memories and abilities it had in life, and is effectively immortal.  Living forever in the shadows often leads to vampires being decadent, while their hunger for blood makes them cruel.",
        "Vampires cast no reflections in silvered mirrors or water, though despite conventional wisdom to the contrary they do reflect in shiny base metals; the innate purity of silver and water simply will not reflect them.",

        "The bite inflicts 1d3 points of damage, then each round thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates (i.e. is healed) for up to 1d6 hit points for each energy level drained.  If the victim dies from the energy drain, they will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later) and thereafter will be under the complete control of the \"parent\" vampire (but is freed if that vampire is ever destroyed).",
        "If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume.  For this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat.  Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and thus a vampire will generally choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite.",
        "Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells.  If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be.  The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.",
        "Creatures of the night obey vampires.  Once per day a vampire can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby).  The creatures summoned arrive 2d6 rounds later and will obey the vampire for up to an hour before leaving.",
        "Vampires can also transform into the form of these creatures, assuming the shape of a giant bat (page 5), giant rat (page 129), or a dire wolf (page 168) at will.  The transformation requires a single round during which the vampire cannot attack.  The flying movement given above is for the giant bat form; the vampire can use the attack forms of the animal shape assumed, as given on the indicated pages.  The vampire cannot activate any of its other powers while in animal form, but effects already active will remain so.",
        "Vampires are powerful indeed, but they do have several specific weaknesses.",
        "First, a vampire can be held at bay by several things, including the smell of garlic, a silver or silvered mirror, or a holy symbol presented by a believer (GM's discretion is advised here, but in general someone threatened by a vampire may be more devout than usual).  In such a situation the vampire cannot approach within 5 feet of the repellent item or character, nor can it make any melee attacks or otherwise touch those within the warded area.",
        "Running water (such as a stream or river) acts as a barrier to a vampire; one cannot cross over any such waterway, neither by bridge or by waterway or even by flying.  It is possible for a vampire to be carried across while lying in its own coffin with the lid closed; the presence of the water flowing beneath the coffin will force the vampire to remain dormant.",
        "Finally, a vampire may not enter any private dwelling without being invited by someone who resides there, and then only if invited while the resident is actually inside the structure.  Public buildings of any sort do not present this problem; even inns are fully accessible to a vampire.",
        "Destroying a vampire is not an easy task.  When reduced to zero hit points or less a vampire becomes incapacitated but is not slain (as previously explained).  If exposed to direct sunlight, the vampire will be utterly destroyed in a single round if it cannot find a way to escape in that time.  Being immersed in running water (as defined above) causes 3d8 points of damage each round, and if reduced to zero or fewer hit points in this way the vampire is destroyed.  If the vampire is cremated in a funeral pyre while in any dormant state it will be destroyed.",
        "The most dramatic method of defeating a vampire is actually the least reliable: driving a wooden stake through its heart.  Doing this will instantly reduce the vampire to zero hit points, and it will remain \"dead\" for so long as the stake is present.  Removal of the stake, however, allows the vampire to begin regenerating as described above.  It is not normally possible to drive a stake through a vampire's heart while it is actively resisting, but this can be done after reducing the monster to zero hit points in the usual way.  Of course, after staking a vampire it is possible to use sunlight, running water, or a funeral pyre as described above to complete its destruction."

Living forever in the shadows often leads to vampires being decadent, while their hunger for blood makes them cruel.",

The vampire regenerates (i.e. is healed) for up to 1d6 hit points for each energy level drained.  If the victim dies from the energy drain, they will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later) and thereafter will be under the complete control of the \"parent\" vampire (but is freed if that vampire is ever destroyed).",
