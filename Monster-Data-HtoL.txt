Hangman trees are horrible, semi-animate creatures that fertilize themselves with dead bodies.  A hangman tree has four animated limbs that can wrap around the necks of living creatures that pass beneath, strangling for 1d6 points of damage per round.  These limbs are arranged evenly around the tree in most cases, and generally no more than one limb can attack any single creature at a time.
The roots of this tree are also animated; they do not attack, but they do pull dead bodies below the surface of the ground for "digestion."

A harpy looks like a giant vulture bearing the torso and face of a human female.  They are able to attack with their claws as well as with a normal weapon, but they are most feared for the power of their song by which they are able to charm living creatures, and, having charmed them, tear them to pieces at their leisure.
All living creatures within a 300' range of one or more singing harpies must make a save vs. Spells or become charmed.  The same harpy's song cannot affect a creature that successfully saves again for 24 hours.  This charm is very powerful, such that a victim will approach the harpy or harpies without fear with a dazed expression on its face.  If the victim is led toward some danger, such as a ravine, fire, or the like, a second saving throw is allowed immediately; however, if this save fails the victim will proceed directly into danger.
Once in reach of a harpy, a charmed victim will surrender completely, even allowing the harpy to attack and kill it without putting up any sort of resistance.  The charm effect lasts one full round after all harpies have ceased singing.

Hellhounds are large canine creatures sheathed in hellish flame; they range in size from 3 to 5 feet at the shoulder (3 feet for a 3 hit die monster, plus 1/2 foot for each additional hit die) with a weight ranging from 100 to 200 pounds (100 pounds at 3 hit dice plus 25 pounds per additional hit die).  These monsters are native to another plane where they hunt in packs; sometimes powerful wizards or evil priests summon them for use as watchdogs.  In addition to biting, each hellhound may breathe fire a number of times per day equal to its hit dice.  In combat, one-third of the time (1-2 on 1d6) a hellhound will choose to breathe fire; otherwise it will attempt to bite.  Roll each round to determine which attack form will be used.
A hellhound's breath weapon is a cone of flame 10' wide at the far end which is 10' long for those with 3 or 4 hit dice, 20' long for those with 5 or 6 hit dice, and 30' long for the largest hellhounds.  This breath weapon does 1d6 points of damage per each hit die of the hellhound to all within the area of effect; a successful saving throw vs. Dragon Breath reduces damage to half normal.
Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice each has.  If generating a group randomly, roll 1d6+1 for the hit dice of each, reading a total of 2 as 3.  A hellhound has an Armor Class equal to 11 plus its hit dice.

Hippogriffs resemble large flying horses with the forefront of a bird of prey; they have wingspans of around 20 feet and an overall body length up to 9 feet, and weigh 900 to 1,200 pounds.  They are found in a variety of colors and patterns, including white, black, tan, brown, and reddish brown with markings such as blazes, stripes, stars, "bald" faces, and so on.
A hippogriff avoids the territories and civilizations of other creatures, dwelling in extreme altitudes.  Griffons sometimes prey upon them, and hippogriffs will generally attack griffons on sight if they have a numerical advantage.
Hippogriffs are omnivorous, entering combat only as defense, save for those times a griffon is met.  They are prized as flying mounts since, unlike griffons, they are relatively safe around horses; note that it is still necessary to raise one in captivity in order to use it as a mount.  A light load for a hippogriff is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Hobgoblins are, basically, man-sized goblins.  They are better organized than their smaller kin, and are also better adapted to life in the sun.  Their skin tone ranges from a greenish tan to a grayish brown, and their hair and eyes are usually dark.  Most wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields for armor.  As with most goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.
Tribes of hobgoblins prefer to live in walled villages, or preferably in castles, and are quite willing to overrun villages or castles built by other races rather than build their own.  Some tribes do choose to live underground.  Hobgoblins have a well-known hatred of elves, and will attack them whenever they think they can win.
One out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP).  Regular hobgoblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior.  In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20', having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength.  In lairs of 30 or more there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with a shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11) having a +2 bonus to damage.  In the lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive.  In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock.  A shaman is equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1.  A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular hobgoblin, but has Magic-User abilities of level 1d6.

Hydras are reptilian creatures with multiple heads.  They are bad-tempered and territorial, but not particularly cunning.
The Armor Class and Hit Dice of a hydra are keyed to the number of heads; specifically, a hydra has a number of Hit Dice exactly equal to the number of heads, and an Armor Class equal to the number of heads plus 11.  Note that these statistics do not change if an individual loses heads, as described below.
A hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however, most who fight them choose to strike at their heads.  If a character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a particular head (i.e. states such intent to the GM) and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be able to attack anymore.  Such damage also applies to the monster's total hit points, of course.
Some hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a swimming rate rather than walking in this case.  A very few hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit a flame 10' wide and 20' long one time per head per day.  This attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it is available; roll for each head which is attacking.  Each such attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs. Dragon Breath reducing the amount by half.  Note that the XP value of a fire-breathing hydra should be higher; treat them as if they have a single asterisk (i.e. add the special ability bonus to the base XP for the monster).

Each such attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs. Dragon Breath reducing the amount by half.  Note that the XP value of a fire-breathing hydra should be higher; treat them as if they have a single asterisk (i.e. add the special ability bonus to the base XP for the monster).

Hyenas are doglike carnivores who exhibit some of the behaviors of canines but are not related.  They not only hunt but also scavenge and steal meals.  A hungry hyena will chew on anything that is even remotely tainted by blood, meat or other food traces.  They will mostly be found in the same savanna-like environments where lions and zebras may be found.  They can live in clans of up to a hundred individuals, though smaller groups are more common.  They are among the favorite pets of gnolls, who may take them into regions where they are not normally found.

An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit.  In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to three 10' cubes, though it is possible for a swarm to become more compact in order to move through a small doorway or narrow corridor.  If the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10' squares and the flying movement above is ignored.
Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm suffers 1d3 points of damage each round.  Damage rolls are doubled if the victim is unarmored (for creatures which do not wear armor, any creature having less than AC 15 is considered unarmored).
Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds if the character manages to exit the swarm.  It is possible to "ward off" the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in this case damage is likewise reduced to 1 point per round.  If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 points of damage per round.  Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm.  An entire swarm can be affected by a sleep spell.  Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from any victims due to smoke, the damage stops immediately).  Finally, a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more round.

Invisible stalkers are monsters from another plane of existence who may be summoned to slay the enemies of a wizard or to perform some other simple task.  They are naturally invisible, and remain so even after attacking.
A summoned invisible stalker does whatever the summoner commands, even if the task takes days or weeks to perform.  The creature is compelled to complete the task regardless of time required.  Invisible stalkers don't like tasks that take too long or are too complicated, and if assigned an unwanted task will try to find a loophole or otherwise subvert the summoner's command.
An invisible stalker's form is amorphous, such that a detect invisible spell shows only an undulating blob-shaped outline.  Don't forget to apply the standard penalty of -4 on the attack die when an invisible stalker is attacked by a creature which is unable to see it.

An ironbane resembles a large armadillo in its overall body plan, but has an anteater-like snout with a long flicking tongue, and long, strangely hare-like back legs which allow it to hop from place to place.  When attacking or pursuing, the ironbane stands up on its hind legs, but when resting or moving slowly it folds them and walks on all four feet.
Like the more common rust monster (as found on page 134), the touch of any part of an ironbane's body transforms metal objects into rust (or verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate).  Non-magical metal attacked by an ironbane, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined.  A non-magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half damage before being destroyed.  Magic weapons or armor lose one "plus" each time they make contact with the ironbane; this loss is permanent.
The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; thus, a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters.  Use a morale check to determine this.
Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to an ironbane and will be ignored.  Silver and copper on the other hand are candy for this creature and one will pursue the tastiest-smelling adventurer in any party.

Black jellies are non-intelligent creatures made of ooze, which will attack any creatures they encounter, sensing them by their warmth and possibly scent.  The entire body of one exudes acid, which is the source of the damage their attacks cause, and they fight by extending pseudopods to strike at their prey.
If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with lightning or electricity, a black jelly suffers no injury, but will be split into two jellies; the GM should divide the original creature's hit dice between the two however they see fit, with the limitation that neither jelly may have less than two hit dice.  A two hit die black jelly is simply unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split further.
Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black jelly, but such an attack will paralyze the jelly for one round per die of damage the attack would normally cause.  Other attack forms will affect a black jelly normally; the preferred method of killing one usually involves fire.
The typical black jelly measures 10 feet across and 2 feet thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds.  Black jellies of smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly as a result of the splitting described above.

The glass jelly's natural habitat is dungeon corridors and caves, where it functions almost as a janitor, consuming carrion and other waste.  Whatever the jelly finds indigestible will remain floating inside its body for a time before being ejected.  Glass jellies are huge, averaging 1,000 cubic feet and weighing as much as 20,000 pounds.  The body of a glass jelly is more viscous than that of other jellies, and it tends to take on the shape of its surroundings such that one in a dungeon with 10' wide corridors might have a shape similar to that of a cube, while one living in round sewer drains under a city would have a cylindrical or half-cylindrical shape.
If a glass jelly encounters a narrow place (a doorway, for example) it will need 2d4 rounds to push through the constriction and will have assumed a new shape after doing so; such a new shape will persist for twice as long as it took to pass the constriction before the monster begins to flow into a shape that fills the available space again.
Glass jellies move quietly, making a faint sucking or slurping sound if anyone thinks to listen.  Combined with their transparency, they are able to surprise prey on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6.  Worse, any living creature hit by a glass jelly must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d4 turns in addition to suffering damage from its acid secretions.
Any treasure indicated will be visible inside the creature, which must be slain if the treasure is to be recovered.

The acid secretions of the gray jelly can dissolve most organic matter and most metals; stone and glass are not affected, however.  After a successful hit, the jelly will stick to the creature attacked, dealing 2d8 damage per round automatically.  Normal (non-magical) armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately.  Any non-magical weapon made of metal or wood which hits a gray jelly will be similarly destroyed.  Magical weapons, armor, and clothing are allowed a saving throw (use the wearer's save vs. Death Ray, adding any magical "plus" value to the roll if applicable).

Green jelly devours flesh and organic materials on contact and is even capable of dissolving metal given enough time.  Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter.  It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and possible food) below.  Green jelly cannot grow in sunlight; even the indirect sunlight of a dense forest will stunt it and prevent it from spreading, and direct sunlight will kill it outright within a turn.
On the first round of contact, the jelly can be scraped off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing the same damage to both the victim and the jelly).  A cure disease spell will destroy a patch of green jelly.  It does not harm stone or enchanted metal, but can dissolve normal metal or enchanted wood in a turn and normal wood in 2d4 rounds.
If not destroyed or scraped off within 6+1d4 rounds, the victim will be completely transformed into more green jelly; such a character or creature cannot be retrieved by any magic short of a wish.

Kobolds are diminutive, dog-faced humanoids with reptilian skin.  They stand between 21/2 and 31/2 feet tall and typically weigh around 40 pounds.  They are cowardly by nature, and in combat they prefer ambushing their foes and constructing traps both clever and deadly; to simply stand and fight is considered the worst possible strategy, and kobolds may fake withdrawing in fear in order to draw enemies into a trap.
Kobolds prefer to rely on ranged combat whenever possible.  They tend to favor daggers and short spears since both can be used in close quarters or thrown at foes at range.  Some may be armed with diminutive bows or crossbows which inflict 1d4 points of damage on a hit.
Kobolds normally dwell underground, while those who choose to dwell above ground may adopt a nocturnal lifestyle.  All possess Darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and generally avoid exposure to daylight.  When they are exposed to sunlight or the effect of continual light they suffer a penalty of -1 to all attack rolls.  Most kobolds wear leather armor in combat.
One out of every six kobolds in any group is a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP).  Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior.  In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve is a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) with an armor class of 14 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength.  In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who wears chain mail with an armor class of 15 (11) and has a movement rate of 10' and a +1 bonus to damage.  In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the kobold king is alive.  In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present).  A shaman is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior kobold statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.  For XP purposes, treat the shaman as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its clerical level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.
Kobolds are sometimes confused with barklings, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a kobold a barkling or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult.

The lion is a large cat found in grasslands and savannas.  They have muscular, broad-chested bodies, short, rounded heads, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.  Adult male lions are larger than females, and in most varieties have a prominent mane. They live in social groups called prides consisting of a few adult males, several related females, and their cubs.
Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates; any hunting group of 1 or 2 is 80% likely to be females, and any group of 3 or more almost certainly are.  Sometimes male lions are rogues, living outside a pride, and in those cases they may hunt as individuals or in pairs.
Lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.  Injured or obviously vulnerable humans may be too much of a temptation though.

They cannot swim while wearing armor; however, they often hide in the water even while armored, standing on the bottom with just nose and eyes exposed (similar to a crocodile).  When they are able to employ this maneuver, lizard men surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.
Lizard men are largely indifferent to other races, being primarily interested in their own survival.  If aroused, however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple but sound tactics.

Lizard Man, Subterranean (Troglodyte)

Subterranean lizard men, also called troglodytes, are superficially very similar to the common variety.  Their skin is paler, and their eyes are red and seem to glow in low light conditions.  Individuals are shorter than the common variety, standing just 5 to 6 feet tall, due in part to their somewhat "hunched" stance.  They weigh about as much as the common type.
These monsters can change color at will, allowing them to blend into underground environments so well that they gain surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6.  Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills.
Subterranean lizard men secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard character races) find the scent repulsive, and those within 10 feet of one must make a saving throw versus poison. Those failing the save suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain within 10 feet of the creature.  Getting out of range negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates the penalty without an additional saving throw. The results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after which a new save must be rolled.

Werebears are humans that can transform into large bears.  When in human form, they typically appear as well-muscled, imposing figures, with an abundance of thick hair.  Werebears typically dwell in deep forests, far from civilization.  They are distrustful of those that they do not know, but will ferociously defend those that they have befriended.

Wereboars gain full control of their transformations quickly, needing only about a year to achieve mastery.  They have just two forms, that of a human and that of a particularly large wild boar or sow.
In human form they tend to have "piggish" traits such as gluttony and cunning, as well as an often strong physical resemblance to swine.  Wereboars usually dislike both hard work and responsibility, but they are bullies who enjoy being in charge.  They are easily bored with mundane things but are excited by violence (whether witnessing it or participating in it).

In addition to assuming the form of a giant rat, wererats can assume a hybrid form.  This ratman form shares the animal form's immunity to normal weapons and can deliver an identical bite, but in this form the wererat may use a normal weapon instead of biting.  Note that the wererat in ratman form cannot bite and use a weapon in the same round.
In human form, wererats tend to be skinny, nervous-looking individuals with pointed noses and lank hair.  Their hair is almost always a rat-like brown color; those with different hair color who become wererats usually undergo a slow change to this color.
Unlike most lycanthropes, wererats prefer to inhabit civilized areas, particularly cities.  They frequently lair in sewers or other underground areas, coming out by night to steal from or kill city folk.  The common stereotype of wererats as thieves is not unfounded; in fact, in many cities wererats lead the guild of thieves, sometimes secretly, sometimes not so much.

Weretigers are humans that can transform into tigers.  In human form, they are generally tall, trim, and very agile.  They tend to live and hunt close to human settlements, and are excellent trackers (5 in 6 chance to track prey in either form).  Weretigers will typically only attack if provoked.  They are capricious and arbitrary to deal with unless whatever offer is made to them is very attractive to them.

Werewolves may be found anywhere humans are found.  They are ferocious predators, equally willing to eat animal or human flesh.  Unlike most lycanthropes, werewolves have no distinguishing features in human form, making them very hard indeed to identify.
Though they usually have only the usual human and animal forms, there are rumors of some who are also able to assume a wolfman form.  In this form they may choose to either bite or use a weapon, and may change back and forth each round.  As with the animal form, the wolfman form is hit only by silver or magical weapons.
